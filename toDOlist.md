# DCSPrep Roadmap Completion toDOlist

Yes — your current TODO is good, but **not optimised for your actual lane**.

The biggest issue: it treats **Parent Portal and Sentral as Tier 1 Josh-owned learning areas**, but from what you’re saying, those are more **awareness + escalation boundary** topics, especially if Ruth Cargill mostly owns Sentral/Parent Portal. So I’d demote those. Keep enough knowledge to triage and hand off well, but don’t build the app around them.

Your app should prioritise what helps you become better at **DCS Level 1 IT support with early Level 2 growth**, not become a general admin systems expert. The DCSPrep TODO already has good principles around Level 1 safety, privacy, triage, escalation, and not copying confidential internal content. 

## 100% optimised DCSPrep TODO order

### P0 — Make the app stable first

Before adding more features:

* [X] Fix all build/runtime errors.
* [X] Lock package versions. Do **not** use `npm audit fix --force`.
* [X] Move the app out of OneDrive if file locking keeps happening.
* [X] Ensure these work:

  * `npm install`
  * `npm run dev`
  * `npm run build`
* [X] Add a simple `FIX_NOTES.md` and `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

**Why this is first:** a broken learning app teaches nothing.

---

# P1 — Core DCS IT support cockpit

Build the homepage around your actual work rhythm.

* [X] Add “Today’s quiet-window PD” dashboard.
* [X] Add quick buttons:

  * Start tiny: 5-minute task
  * 20-minute focus block
  * Review due flashcards
  * Do one scenario step
  * Log PD
* [X] Add reminder: “Tickets, walk-ups, calls, and Paul’s instructions come first.”
* [X] Add “What should I study next?” based on weak areas.

**Why:** You need the app to help you use quiet work pockets well without overstepping.

---

# P2 — Question-first learning engine

This should come before adding heaps of content.

* [X] Rebuild modules so each starts with a diagnostic question, not reading.
* [X] Add confidence rating before answers.
* [X] Require explanation for answers.
* [X] Add scoring for:

  * correctness
  * reasoning
  * risk/judgement
* [X] Add mixed question types:

  * MCQ
  * short answer
  * order-the-steps
  * scenario response
  * explain-it-simply
* [X] Add plausible distractors only.
* [X] Add error log.
* [X] Add spaced repetition.

**Why:** This fixes the exact weakness we found in your CompTIA quiz process.

---

# P3 — Highest-priority Josh-lane modules

These are the modules I’d build first.

## 1. Login, Password, Lockout, MFA, and Account Basics

* [X] username format checks
* [X] password reset boundaries

* DHCP vs DNS vs gateway
* SSID selection
* forget/rejoin network
* compare with another device
* one-device vs many-device issue
* what to include when escalating

**Very high relevance and one of your known growth areas.**

## 5. Ticket Notes and Escalation Quality

* who / where / device
* exact symptom
* scope
* steps tried
* urgency / impact
* next action
* privacy-safe wording

**This may be the highest-value module of all.**

## 6. Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, and File Access Basics

# P4 — Scenario Lab before more modules

Build scenarios that match real DCS work.

* [X] Teacher laptop won’t display on ViewBoard.
* [X] HDMI works but no audio.
* [X] Student laptop has 169.254 IP.
* [X] One classroom has Wi-Fi but no internet.
* [X] Printer jobs stuck in queue.
* [X] Laser printer toner rubs off.
* [X] Staff reports phishing email.
* [X] New staff member has missing access.
* [X] Former staff member still appears active in Teams.
* [X] Shared OneDrive/Teams file access problem.

Each scenario must end with a **Jira-style note**.

**Why:** This is the bridge from “knowing stuff” to “doing IT support well.”

## Scenario: HDMI works but no audio (Classroom AV)

**User report:** “The laptop shows on the ViewBoard, but there’s no sound.”

**Goal:** Restore audio or capture clean evidence to escalate (without guessing).

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Clarify + scope**
   - Ask: “Is it **no sound on the laptop** too, or only through the ViewBoard/speakers?”
   - Ask: “What’s the device (teacher laptop/student BYOD), and what cable/adaptor (HDMI/USB‑C dock)?”
2. **Basic checks (fast wins)**
   - Check Windows volume and mute (including app volume).
   - Confirm the ViewBoard volume isn’t muted / set to the correct input audio.
3. **Correct output device**
   - On Windows: set output to the HDMI / display audio device (e.g. “ViewBoard/HDMI/Display Audio”).
   - If present, disable Bluetooth/headset output temporarily to prevent auto-routing.
4. **Cable / port / adapter sanity**
   - Reseat HDMI both ends; try a different HDMI port or known-good cable if available.
   - If using a USB‑C dongle/dock, try direct HDMI or another dongle if available.
5. **Differentiate device vs room**
   - Test: play audio locally (laptop speakers). If local works but HDMI doesn’t, it’s routing/AV path.
   - If another laptop works in the same room, likely device-side; if no laptop works, likely room-side.
6. **Escalation trigger**
   - Escalate if: multiple devices fail in the room, speakers/amp issues suspected, or ports physically damaged.

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t open or share personal media; use built-in test sounds.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: [Teacher], Room [X], Windows laptop [asset if known]
- **Symptom**: HDMI video OK to ViewBoard; **no audio via ViewBoard speakers**
- **Scope**: (single device / multiple devices tested)
- **Steps tried**: volume/mute checked; output device set to HDMI; reseated cable; tried alternate cable/port; tested laptop local audio
- **Result**: (what changed / didn’t change)
- **Impact/urgency**: (e.g. class starting now / low urgency)
- **Next action**: (resolved) OR escalate to AV/ICT with evidence
- **Privacy**: no personal content used; Windows test sound only

## Scenario: Student laptop has 169.254 IP (APIPA / DHCP)

**User report:** “Student can’t get on the internet; IP shows 169.254.x.x.”

**Goal:** Identify likely DHCP/association issue and resolve if safe at Level 1, or escalate with evidence.

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Confirm what network they’re on**
   - Ask: which SSID (student/staff/guest), and is it “connected, no internet” or not connected?
2. **Confirm APIPA**
   - Check: IP address \(169.254.\*\) indicates no DHCP lease.
3. **Fast remediation**
   - Forget the Wi‑Fi network → reconnect (re-enter credentials if applicable).
   - Toggle Wi‑Fi off/on; airplane mode on/off.
   - Restart device if quick steps fail.
4. **Compare / isolate**
   - Test another device on the same SSID in the same location.
   - If many devices in area fail, suspect network/DHCP outage; if only one device, device-side issue.
5. **DHCP renew (Windows-friendly path)**
   - If allowed: `ipconfig /release` then `ipconfig /renew` (or network reset) and re-check IP.
6. **Escalation trigger**
   - Escalate if: multiple devices affected, DHCP scope issue suspected, or it persists after forget/rejoin + restart.

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t collect student personal files; only collect network troubleshooting facts.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: Student BYOD, location [building/room], device type (Win/Mac)
- **Symptom**: Wi‑Fi connected but assigned **169.254.x.x**; no internet
- **Scope**: (only this device / multiple devices affected)
- **Steps tried**: forget/rejoin SSID; toggle Wi‑Fi; restart; DHCP renew (if applicable)
- **Evidence**: SSID name, signal strength (approx), time observed
- **Next action**: (resolved) OR escalate “possible DHCP issue” with scope evidence

## Scenario: Printer jobs stuck in queue (Windows printing)

**User report:** “My print jobs are stuck; nothing prints.”

**Goal:** Determine whether it’s user queue, wrong printer, authentication/release flow, or device-side issue.

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Clarify printing method**
   - Ask: Are they printing to a specific device printer, or a managed queue / follow-me / release printer?
2. **Check wrong destination**
   - Confirm selected printer name; try printing to the known correct queue.
3. **Clear simple blockers**
   - Ensure printer isn’t “offline” on the user device.
   - Remove one stuck job; retry a simple test page.
4. **Restart print spooler (if appropriate)**
   - If jobs remain stuck: restart the Print Spooler service (or reboot PC if that’s the local process).
5. **Differentiate user vs printer**
   - Test from another user/device to same printer/queue.
   - Check printer front panel for errors (paper jam, out of paper/toner, offline).
6. **Escalation trigger**
   - Escalate if: printer hardware error, queue issue affecting multiple users, or managed print/release system issue.

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t ask to print sensitive student documents for testing; use a benign test page.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: [Staff], [room], Windows PC [asset]
- **Symptom**: print jobs stuck “Spooling/Printing” in queue; no output
- **Scope**: (single user / multiple users)
- **Steps tried**: confirmed printer/queue; removed stuck job; test page; reboot / spooler restart; checked printer panel status
- **Result**: (what happened)
- **Next action**: (resolved) OR escalate with printer/queue name + scope

## Scenario: Laser printer toner rubs off (print quality)

**User report:** “The print looks OK but the toner smudges/rubs off.”

**Goal:** Recognize likely fuser/consumable issue and escalate appropriately with clear evidence.

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Confirm symptom**
   - Ask: “Does the toner smear immediately after printing? Only on certain paper? All pages or some?”
2. **Rule out user-side causes**
   - Confirm paper type is standard and dry; avoid glossy/incorrect stock.
3. **Try a controlled test**
   - Print a simple test page from printer menu (if available) or a basic document.
4. **Check consumables / maintenance status**
   - Note toner level; check for alerts (fuser/drum/maintenance kit).
5. **Differentiate single device vs multiple**
   - If multiple users see it from same printer, it’s printer-side.
6. **Escalation trigger**
   - Escalate as likely fuser/maintenance issue; include examples and printer ID/location.

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t attach real student work as evidence; use a benign test print.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: Printer [name/asset], location [room]
- **Symptom**: toner **smears/rubs off** after printing; appears unfused
- **Scope**: multiple users confirmed / single user
- **Steps tried**: tested with standard paper; printed printer self-test; checked panel alerts/consumables
- **Evidence**: description of smear behavior; time/date; (optional) photo of benign test page
- **Next action**: escalate to service/ICT for fuser/maintenance assessment

## Scenario: Staff reports phishing email (security / triage)

**User report:** “I got an email asking for my password / it looks suspicious.”

**Goal:** Safely triage, reduce risk, and escalate with the right details (without spreading the threat).

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Immediate safety**
   - Ask: “Did you click any links or open attachments? Did you enter credentials?”
   - If yes, escalate urgently and advise password change via approved self-service path (per policy).
2. **Preserve evidence (safely)**
   - Ask the staff member to **not forward** the email to others unless there’s a known reporting method.
   - Capture: subject, sender display name + address, time received, and screenshot of headers only if allowed.
3. **Containment**
   - If it’s clearly malicious, advise to delete after reporting via the approved reporting method (if applicable).
4. **Check scope**
   - Ask if other staff received the same email; note approximate count/locations.
5. **Escalation trigger**
   - Escalate to ICT/security with the captured details; include whether credentials were entered.

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t copy the full email body into tickets if it contains malicious links or personal data; summarize safely.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: Staff [name], device [managed PC?], campus [X]
- **Symptom**: suspected phishing email received
- **Evidence captured**: sender address, subject, timestamp, screenshot of preview (no clickable links), whether links opened/credentials entered
- **Scope**: (only reporter / others affected)
- **Urgency**: high if clicked/credentials entered
- **Next action**: escalated to ICT/security; user advised not to interact further

## Scenario: New staff member has missing access (onboarding / permissions)

**User report:** “New staff can’t access [system/files/Teams] needed for their role.”

**Goal:** Triage what’s missing, gather role/context, and route to the right owner with complete details.

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Identify the missing thing(s)**
   - Ask: which systems/resources (email, Teams, shared drive, app), and what exact error message.
2. **Confirm identity + start date**
   - Confirm staff name, department, campus, start date, and whether they can sign in successfully.
3. **Scope and dependency checks**
   - Are they missing access everywhere or only one system?
   - If access is group-based, ask what role/team they should match (e.g. “same as [existing staff]”).
4. **Local device sanity**
   - If it’s just one app: sign out/in, check they’re using the correct account, try web vs desktop app.
5. **Escalation trigger**
   - If it’s permissions/groups/provisioning: escalate with role + manager approval context (if required).

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t request or store passwords; don’t grant access without the proper approval path.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: New staff [name], campus [X], device [asset if known]
- **Symptom**: missing access to [resource/system]; error text [exact]
- **Scope**: can sign in? yes/no; other systems OK? yes/no
- **Role context**: department, start date, needs “same access as [peer role/name]”
- **Steps tried**: sign out/in; web vs app; confirmed correct account
- **Next action**: escalate to access owner with complete role/approval details

## Scenario: Shared OneDrive/Teams file access problem (M365 files)

**User report:** “I can’t open a shared file in Teams/OneDrive” or “I can’t see the file someone shared.”

**Goal:** Determine if it’s permission, link type, ownership, sync, or wrong account; resolve or escalate cleanly.

**Turns (4–6):**

1. **Clarify where the file lives**
   - Ask: Is it in a **Team channel**, a **SharePoint site**, or someone’s **OneDrive**?
2. **Clarify the failure**
   - Ask: “Do you get ‘Access denied’, ‘Request access’, ‘File not found’, or it just doesn’t appear?”
3. **Account sanity**
   - Ensure they’re signed into the correct work account (web vs desktop app mismatches are common).
4. **Link + permissions check**
   - If they have a link, test opening in browser; confirm if link is org-only vs specific people.
   - If it’s a Team file: confirm membership in the Team/channel.
5. **Sync vs permission**
   - If it’s missing in File Explorer but present on web, it’s a sync issue; if missing on both, likely permission/location.
6. **Escalation trigger**
   - Escalate if ownership/permissions changes are needed; include file path, owner, and exact error.

**Risk / privacy note:** Don’t ask users to send confidential file contents; capture only the path/link and error message.

**Model Jira-style note (example):**

- **Who/where/device**: [Staff], device [asset], app (Teams/OneDrive/Web)
- **File location**: Team/Site/OneDrive; path if known
- **Symptom**: access denied / request access / not found / missing
- **Steps tried**: verified correct account; opened in browser; confirmed Team membership; checked web vs sync
- **Next action**: resolved (explain) OR escalate to owner/site admin with file path + error

# P5 — Support-quality outputs

Once scenarios exist, make the app help you create useful artefacts.

* [X] Printer symptom-to-cause matrix
* [X] ViewBoard quick-fix flow
* [X] Wi-Fi triage checklist
* [X] Login/password support checklist
* [X] New user access checklist
* [X] Website unblock request checklist
* [X] Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive triage guide
* [X] Escalation note examples
* [ ] “What system owns this issue?” decision tree

**Why:** These create visible value without demanding more permissions.

---

# P6 — Lower-priority awareness modules

These should exist, but smaller and later.

## Sentral Awareness and Escalation

Not “master Sentral.” More like:

* what Sentral is used for
* common symptoms users report
* what details to capture
* what belongs to Ruth/admin
* when to escalate
* what not to touch

## Parent Portal Awareness

Again, not deep ownership:

* parent says they can’t access portal
* access key issue
* family details update request
* what info to capture
* handoff to Ruth/admin
* privacy-safe wording

**Verdict:** Keep these as **small boundary modules**, not P0 core modules.

---

# P7 — Deeper technical growth

These are important, but after the real DCS support flow exists.

* [ ] VLANs and guest Wi-Fi segmentation
* [ ] Group Policy vs MDM
* [ ] Intune/Jamf device management concepts
* [ ] Cloud models: SaaS / PaaS / IaaS / DaaS
* [ ] Ports and protocols
* [ ] Endpoint security basics
* [ ] Scripting/automation basics

**Why:** These help your Level 2 growth, but they should not displace daily support skills.

---

# P8 — Evidence and PD export

* [ ] PD log
* [ ] monthly summary
* [ ] evidence pack
* [ ] copy-to-clipboard manager-safe summary
* [ ] link modules/scenarios/practical outputs to PD entries

**Why:** Useful, but only once the learning engine has meaningful activity to summarise.

---

# P9 — Readiness graphs

Keep them, but make them evidence-based.

* [ ] A+ readiness graph
* [ ] Level 2 readiness graph
* [ ] School IT manager readiness graph
* [ ] label unsupported domains as “estimate”
* [ ] update scores from actual performance

**Why:** Motivating, but less urgent than real learning loops.

---

## Final optimised priority list

If I reduced everything to the cleanest order:

1. **Fix app stability**
2. **Build question-first engine**
3. **Build PD cockpit / quiet-window dashboard**
4. **Build core Josh-lane modules**

   * login/password
   * ViewBoards/classroom display
   * printers/photocopiers
   * Wi-Fi/DNS/DHCP/gateway
   * ticket notes/escalation
   * Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive
5. **Build Scenario Lab with Jira-note scoring**
6. **Add Error Log + spaced repetition**
7. **Add practical support outputs**
8. **Add PD Log + Evidence Pack**
9. **Add smaller awareness modules**

   * Sentral
   * Parent Portal
10. **Add deeper Level 2/manager technical modules**
11. **Make readiness graphs evidence-based**

That is the order I’d give Codex.


This file turns [docs/dcsprep-upskilling-roadmap.md](docs/dcsprep-upskilling-roadmap.md) into the exact remaining work needed to make the roadmap complete.

Use this as the execution order.

## Completion Standard

The roadmap is complete only when:

1. Every numbered task in this file is complete.
2. Every Tier 1 DCS workflow area has question-first training content.
3. Every major workflow area has flashcards, mixed questions, scenario practice, and one practical output.
4. Scenario Lab includes the full roadmap scenario set and Jira-note scoring.
5. Review, error logging, focus modes, PD logging, knowledge-base practice, and evidence export all work together.
6. Readiness graphs are driven mainly by real evidence, not placeholder estimates.
7. No feature encourages unsafe production admin practice or storage of sensitive DCS data.

## 1. Finalize the content architecture and storage model

- [ ] Extend shared types for modules, question types, flashcards, study techniques, scenario turns, scenario note scoring, practical outputs, knowledge-base drafts, evidence-pack summaries, and internal-source metadata.
- [ ] Add a single DCS workflow taxonomy covering systems, ticket themes, ownership boundaries, support level, and escalation category.
- [ ] Add localStorage schema entries for:
  - assessment attempts
  - confidence ratings
  - self-rubric scores
  - scenario note scores
  - flashcard box state
  - due-review state
  - practical outputs
  - knowledge-base drafts
  - evidence-pack settings
- [ ] Add storage versioning and migration so existing users do not lose progress when the model expands.
- [ ] Add privacy-safe metadata fields so content can be tagged as derived from internal DCS resources without copying confidential text.
- [ ] Add helper functions for loading, saving, and validating all new progress objects.
- [ ] Add tests for schema validation, migrations, and default-state creation.

Done when:

- the data model can represent every planned roadmap feature without ad hoc fields
- local progress survives upgrades cleanly
- no feature needs a redesign because of missing data structures

## 2. Rebuild the module experience so it is question-first

- [X] Redesign the module landing view so the first action is a short diagnostic, not passive reading.
- [ ] Standardize every module to this structure:
  - diagnostic questions
  - flashcards
  - short-answer recall
  - explain-it-simply prompt
  - concept sort or categorization activity where relevant
  - scenario step or scenario prompt
  - practical output
  - review queue
- [ ] Add a reusable module progress model that tracks completion by activity type, not only by reading or quiz completion.
- [ ] Show weak areas, due review, and next best action at the top of each module.
- [ ] Make explanation content appear after recall attempts or alongside guided reveal, so the flow stays retrieval-first.
- [ ] Update module cards and module detail pages to show:
  - due items
  - weak topics
  - estimated time
  - practical output status
- [ ] Add tests for module completion math and next-step recommendation logic.

Done when:

- every module follows one consistent question-first workflow
- the user can start learning from prompts and practice instead of reading first

## 3. Implement the study-technique layer the roadmap depends on

- [ ] Add Active Recall mode that hides answers until Josh attempts recall.
- [ ] Add Feynman prompts with a simple rubric for:
  - clarity
  - correctness
  - practical relevance
- [ ] Add explicit Leitner-style flashcard boxes or labels on top of the existing spaced-repetition system.
- [ ] Add concept-sorting exercises for symptoms, systems, ownership boundaries, and escalation decisions.
- [ ] Add mnemonic-builder prompts for ports, workflows, and system distinctions.
- [ ] Add Cornell-style guided note templates for module review and scenario debrief.
- [ ] Add SQ3R-style reading companion prompts for safely turning internal resources into questions and summaries.
- [ ] Add micro-learning task cards that fit short quiet windows.
- [ ] Add a Pomodoro-style timer tied to one learning task.
- [ ] Add end-of-session prompts:
  - What did I learn?
  - Where would this show up at DCS?
  - What is the next small step?

Done when:

- the app directly supports the learning methods named in the roadmap
- study sessions can be short, structured, and active without feeling vague

## 4. Build the missing Tier 1 DCS workflow modules

For every new module below, complete all of these sub-items:

- [ ] Write 3 to 5 short lessons.
- [ ] Add at least 10 flashcards.
- [ ] Add at least 8 mixed assessment items.
- [ ] Add at least 1 scenario prompt or embedded scenario step.
- [ ] Add at least 1 practical output.
- [ ] Add ownership-boundary notes showing what belongs to ICT, admin, leadership, or another system owner.
- [ ] Add a privacy-safe example of good ticket or escalation wording.

Required new modules:

- [ ] 4.1 `Parent Portal Registration`
- [ ] 4.2 `Parent Portal Details Updates`
- [ ] 4.3 `Sentral Support`
- [ ] 4.4 `OurDCS / Schoolbox Support`

  - stronger Jira examples
  - better scope and urgency writing
  - privacy-safe wording practice

Done when:

- the existing modules cover real DCS-style first-line work instead of staying too conceptual

## 6. Expand the strict assessment bank to roadmap level

- [ ] Raise the total strict question bank to at least 80 scored items.
- [ ] Ensure every Tier 1 module has at least 8 scored items.
- [ ] Ensure every expanded technical module has enough questions to test real application, not just definitions.
- [ ] Include all required question types:
  - MCQ
  - short answer
  - order the steps
  - scenario response
